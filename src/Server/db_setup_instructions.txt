# Database Setup Instructions

To create the necessary tables for the order history functionality, follow these steps:

1. Connect to your MySQL database:
```
mysql -u root -p
```

2. Enter your password (1234 as configured in db.js)

3. Select the database:
```
USE klimatholoddatabase;
```

4. Run the SQL script from this file:
```
source /path/to/project/src/Server/db_setup.sql
```

Alternative method:
1. Copy the contents of db_setup.sql
2. Paste them directly into your MySQL command line client after connecting to the database

These commands will create:
- orders table: to store order information
- order_items table: to store individual items in each order
- necessary indexes for better performance

This setup is required for the order history functionality to work properly.
